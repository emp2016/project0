                    The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force.
                    Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period,
                    the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War
                    against the Kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to
                    the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known
                    as the Senior Service. From the middle decades of the 17th century, and
                    through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and
                    later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th
                    century, it was the world's most powerful navy until surpassed by
                    the United States Navy during the Second World War. The Royal Navy played
                    a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world
                    power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this
                    historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it
                    as "the Royal Navy" without qualification.
