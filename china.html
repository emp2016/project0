                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    PLA Navy, is the naval warfare branch of the People's Liberation Army,
                    which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of China
                    and, by default, the national armed forces of the
                    People's Republic of China. The PLAN can trace its
                    lineage to naval units fighting during the Chinese Civil
                    War and was established in September 1950. Throughout the
                    1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union provided
                    assistance to the PLAN in the form of naval advisers
                    and export of equipment and technology. Until the late 1980s,
                     the PLAN was largely a riverine and littoral force
                     (brown-water navy). However, by the 1990s, following the
                     fall of the Soviet Union and a shift towards a more
                     forward-oriented foreign and security policy,
                     the leaders of the Chinese military were freed from
                     worrying over land border disputes, and instead turned
                     their attention towards the seas. This led to the
                     development of the People's Liberation Army Navy
                     into a green-water navy by 2009. Before the 1990s the
                     PLAN had traditionally played a subordinate role to the
                     People's Liberation Army Ground Force.
