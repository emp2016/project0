                    The Russian Navy - Military-Maritime Fleet of the Russian Federation is the naval arm of the Russian Armed Forces. It has existed in various
                    forms since 1696, the present iteration of which was formed in January 1992 when it succeeded the
                    Navy of the Commonwealth of Independent States (which had itself succeeded the Soviet Navy following the
                    dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December 1991). The first iteration of the Russian Navy was established
                    by Peter the Great (Peter I) in October 1696. Ascribed to him is the oft quoted statement: "A ruler that has but
                    an army has one hand, but he who has a navy has both."
                    The symbols of the Russian Navy, the St. Andrew's ensign, and most of its traditions were established personally by Peter I.
