                    A warship or combatant ship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare.
                    Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state.
                    As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually
                    faster and more manoeuvrable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo,
                    a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew.
                    Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals,
                    cooperatives and corporations.
